It doesn't simulate writing, only reading currently. 

sample calling of the program 

./cachesim  -ds 4096 -bs 16 -as 8 -wp 1 -vs 8  -in test.txt

-ds is the data cache size 
-bs is the block size 
-as is the associativity
-wp is the write policy 
-vs is the victim cache size in blocks 
-in is the input file     

for the write policy 0 is write back and 1 is write though
	
	
	 
The input file format is 

x y z 

where s 
    x = 0 for read 
    x = 1 for write, currently not working/written
    y is the number of number of bytes being written or read 
    z is the address
